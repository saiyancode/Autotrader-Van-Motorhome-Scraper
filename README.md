# Autotrader-Van-Motorhome-Scraper

I needed to scrape some data in order to inform myself on what statistically is a good deal when coming to buy a van and the resale value I can expect once the project is over.

# Autotrader Selenium Scraper

  - Add the URL you'd like to scrape data from
  - As long as that URL is a van or motorhome page the script will run until data has been scraped from every page

You will need:
  - Selenium with Chrome or Phantom JS browser
  - Selenium & Beautifulsoup

Any questions hit me up on twitter (@willceciltech) or open an issue!
